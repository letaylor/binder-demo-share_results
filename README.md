binder-demo-share_results
=========================

Demo for sharing results (e.g., a csv file) through an interactive web interface using [qgrid](https://qgrid.readthedocs.io), [Binder](https://mybinder.org), and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).


Quick Start
-----------

1. Copy and paste the link to this repository from your browser here:  https://mybinder.org

    This will produce this link which can be shared:
    https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/letaylor/binder-demo-share_results/master

2. Click on index.ipynb within Jupyter Notebook.

3. Click on the 'Run' button. This will launch an interactive table showing the results from the 'data.csv' file within this repository. 


Questions?
----------

See the [Binder FAQ](http://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html). Below is a common question from the FAQ.

1. How long will my Binder session last?

    Binder is meant for interactive and ephemeral interactive coding, meaning that it is ideally suited for relatively short sessions. Binder will automatically shut down user sessions that have more than 10 minutes of inactivity (if you leave your window open, this will be counted as "activity").
    
    Binder aims to provide at least 12 hours of session time per user session. Beyond that, we cannot guarantee that the session will remain running.

* The 'data.csv' demo file is the output from the demo [QTLtools](https://qtltools.github.io/qtltools) dataset.
